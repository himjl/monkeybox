# Introduction
This is a repository with information about an in-home NHP behavioral experimentation system. 
Currently, it is not a complete guide to get started from zero; right now, it mainly contains information on how to construct a Bluetooth-actuated fluid delivery system. 


### Hardware: building a monkeybox system from scratch
A Bluetooth-actuated pump is needed to deliver fluid to the subject. This repo contains the parts list for this system, in `/hardware`. 

### Software: implementing tasks using MWorks
MWorks is used to implement the task logic and interface with the pump. Here is the [link](mworks.github.io) to the MWorks documentation.
