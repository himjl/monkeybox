This project was designed to use MonkeyWorks, which uses MWEL as the "language" with which tasks are expressed and run 
(with the MonkeyWorks server running on an iPad the NHP has access to, and a computer running a MonkeyWorks client).  

#### Editing MWEL
Located [here](https://github.com/cstawarz/mwel_sublime) is a Sublime Text 3 syntax definition for `.mwel` files 
(a proprietary format specific to Mworks) files.
