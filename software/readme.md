This project was designed to use MonkeyWorks, which uses MWEL as the "language" with which tasks are expressed and run 
(with the MonkeyWorks server running on an iPad the NHP has access to, and a computer running a MonkeyWorks client).  

#### Editing MWEL
Located [here](https://github.com/cstawarz/mwel_sublime) is a Sublime Text 3 syntax definition for `.mwel` files 
(a proprietary format specific to Mworks) files.  


#### Flashing Bluetooth PCB
Apart from implementing your task using MWEL, the Arduino Feather needs to be programmed so an MW server instance can communicate with it (e.g. to send rewards to the subject).
